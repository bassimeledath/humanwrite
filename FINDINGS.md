# FINDINGS (append-only)

Entry format -- one per experiment batch or decision point:

    ## [YYYY-MM-DD] <milestone> / <comparison-id>
    HYPOTHESIS: what we believed and why (cite RESEARCH_CONTEXT items)
    SETUP: arms, configs (hashes), budget class, seeds, data split hashes
    RESULTS: table. Primary endpoint as delta vs SFT baseline AND vs
             human-vs-human floor. All gates. CIs where applicable.
    DECISION: keep / discard / merge / promote / park. Justify.
    NEXT: the next preregistered comparison.

Rules: never delete or edit past entries (append corrections). Negative
results get full entries. Assumptions relied on get flagged here.
